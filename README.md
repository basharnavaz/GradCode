# Code Documentation
Hi, this is where I will put as much as I can to help you learn the tools needed to execute Quadcopter Flights uisng PX4 Firmware and a Ground Station Computer running Robot Operating System.

## Robot Operating System
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

To familiarize yourself with the different concepts of ROS. Primarily you should know, what a _package_ is and other concepts like, _nodes, topics, messages_. Although there are many tutorials on YouTube, Udacity etc, I recommend following through the tutorials in the ROS Wiki. [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
